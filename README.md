# Bootcamp-Project #11: Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This Project was about getting to know React Native and building my first app. I focused on Navigation and implemented StackNavigation as well as DrawerNavigation.

## Learning content and lessons learned:
- How to build mobile apps with React Native.
- How to use styled components.

The main struggle I had this week was the very little instructions and guidence this week. The expected endproduct was unclear and since React Native is full of options and modules to work with it was quite hard to tell what was expected. I started out by getting an overview on the basics, what React Native offers and in a next step I started by sketching the structure for a very easy App. I found good ressources online, which helped me especially with structuring my project. Codewise I had little struggles, thanks to my structural approach. Since i had very little time this week, my project is lacking styling and creativity.
