# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This Project was about getting to know React Native and building my first app. I focused on Navigation and implemented StackNavigation as well as DrawerNavigation.

## The problem

The main struggle I had this week was keeping focus on the goal. We got very little instructions and guidens this week, which made it pretty hard. React Native is full of options and modules to work with. So I started by getting an overview on the basics, what React Native offers and in a next step I started by sketching the structure for a very easy App. I found good ressources online, which helped me especially with structuring my project. Codewise I had little struggles, thanks to my structural approach. Unfortunately I had some struggles working with the branch on github. My commits somehow didn't work as I wished and I ended up overwriting my code with the empty code on saturday afternoon. I restarted again, but have now to hand in an unstyled project. Also I couldn't make the video shown on the phone (only on web). So hints would be appreciated.

Snack didn't work for me - sorry.
